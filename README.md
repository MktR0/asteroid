* Avoid collisions with asteroids
* Survive as long as possible

## Current Features
* [ðŸ—¸] Smooth ship movement and rotation
* [ðŸ—¸] Asteroid spawning system
* [ðŸ—¸] Collision detection
* [ðŸ—¸] Score tracking
* [ðŸ—¸] Explosion effects on asteroid destruction


## Potential Future Updates:
* [ ] Implement multiple lives and respawning 
* [ ] Add sound effects
* [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement 
* [ ] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing 
* [ ] Add a background image 
* [ ] Create different weapon types 
* [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round 
* [ ] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one 
* [ ] Add a shield power*up 
* [ ] Add a speed power*up 
* [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped
